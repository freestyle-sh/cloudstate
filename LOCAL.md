# Building Locally

To build the project locally, you will need to have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once you have Rust installed, you can build the project by running:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be located at `target/release/cli`.

> [!NOTE]  
> For actual use, you'll want to alias the binary to `cloudstate` for ease of use.
